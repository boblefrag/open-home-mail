a.k.a. Ohm

Ohm is a project that intents to create a Raspberry-Pi iso featuring a full
email stack (smtp/imap/pop servers, spam-fighting tools, webmail...).

It aims to provide a cheap, easy-to-use, home-based mail service, to free the
people from evil web-based, ad-bloated, privacy-borderline yahotgle services,
packed in a simple plug-and-play box.
